Circle Detection Benchmark Dataset (CDBD)

Images can be in either RGB or grayscale and various dimension.
Human labeled circles in the text files named similar to the images
with one circle per line, (x, y, r) in image coordinates.

If you use the dataset for your research, please cite our paper:

Circle Completeness", in the IEEE International Conference on 
Image Processing, 2016.
